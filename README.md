# Robotics-1
In my Robotics 1 undergraduate course at UCA, I designed and built a small ground robot using a Raspberry Pi. The photos below show the design process of testing the wheels/motors, updating the chassis, and incorporating the Raspberry Pi. Next, I completed three projects: 

1. [Project 1: Wall Bouncer](https://github.com/willward20/Robotics-1/tree/main/Project-1-Wall-Bouncer) in which the robot avoided obstacles using ultrasonic sensors connected to the Pi's GPIO pins.
2. [Project 2: Aruco Tracker](https://github.com/willward20/Robotics-1/tree/main/Project-2-Aruco-Tracker) in which the robot uses a Pi Camera to detect Aruco tags and drive towards them.
3. [Project 3: ROS 2 Painter](https://github.com/willward20/Robotics-1/tree/main/Project-3-ROS2-Painter) in which the robot (and a virtual turtle) is controlled using ROS 2 commands.
